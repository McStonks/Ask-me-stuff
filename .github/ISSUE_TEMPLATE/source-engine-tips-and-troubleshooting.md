**What's your problem/What do you want to know?**
A somewhat clear description of the problem or what you want to know.
Ex. How do I make a material non-portalable/I put "%noportal" into example.vmt and it's still portalable!

**Which engine are you using?**
Goldsrc and Xash3D are used in Half-Life 1, TFC, Counter-Strike, Quake, [...]
Source is used in Half-Life 2, Half-Life Source, both Portal games, CSS, CSGO (it has a few source 2 stuff though), Team Fortress 2, [...]
Source 2 is used in Half-Life Alyx, Dota 2 Reborn, The Lab (Robot Repair only), [...]

**OS, monitor resolution, graphics card**
Which OS, resolution, and graphics card you got? For me, it's Windows 11, 1920x1080, AMD Raedon something (I forgot the exact name, can't check cause I'm on my Chromebook). 

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the problem or whatever here.
