Just make issues on here to ask me questions and request maps and stuff, because I'm on here often.

The questions can relate to anything related to Half-Life, Portal, Team Fortress 2, any Valve stuff, even modding Valve's games.

Don't worry about the time you ask, I'll usually respond at some point during the week you post it.

Remember, I may be good at Hammer, but I'm no Valve employee. My maps probably won't be very high quality, but give me a layout (aka how high the ceiling, where the walls go, etc.), and I'm gonna be working hard on making that map good.

Don't worry about how embarassing you might think it is, just ask away, I honestly don't care how embarassing it is.

At the time I'm writing this, the only PCs I have are my Chromebook and Samsung¹, so I can only make source trilogy maps using online map editors. If anybody finds any online or android source map editors out there, tell me through discussions.

I can still play _some_ goldsource and source games, though, because of Xash3D, that Nvidia Shield HL2 thing, and Nvidia GeForce. But only _some_, as some games are incompatible with them, such as Opposing Force, Half-Life: Source, etc.

My main account (Slambo312) probably won't be online for a while, since I only really used my laptop for that.

¹ I consider my phone a PC because it's technically a personal computer, and its specs are good enough that it can play Pojav (an amazing port of Minecraft Java, which uses a technically legal way of getting Minecraft) with like 20 mods and still run smoothly.

# And remember, my fellow gamers: Your lag may seem bad to you, but people like me can play games at 15 fps and be fine with it.
