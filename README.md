Just make issues on here to ask me questions and request maps and stuff, because I'm on here often.

The questions can relate to anything related to Half-Life, Portal, Team Fortress 2, any Valve stuff, even modding Valve's games.

Don't worry about the time you ask, I'll usually respond at some point during the week you post it.

Remember, I may be good at Hammer, but I'm no Valve employee. My maps probably won't be very high quality, but give me a layout (aka how high the ceiling, where the walls go, etc.), and I'm gonna be working hard on making that map good.

Don't worry about how embarassing you might think it is, just ask away, I honestly don't care how embarassing it is.

At the time I'm writing this, my laptop isn't working, so I can only make source trilogy maps using online map editors (still got a crappy chromebook). If anybody finds any online or android source map editors out there, just put it in an issue and tell me.
