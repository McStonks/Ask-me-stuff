Just make issues on here to ask me questions and request maps and stuff, because I'm on here often.

The questions can relate to anything related to Half-Life, Portal, Team Fortress 2, the Source engine trilogy (Goldsource/Goldsrc, Source, Source 2), etc.

Don't worry about the time you ask, I'll usually respond between 30 seconds to 5 hours after you post the issue.

Remember, I may be good at Hammer, but I'm no Valve employee. My maps probably won't be very high quality, but if you show me how you want the layout to be like (via a drawing, Portal 2 PeTI screenshot, or even a Minecraft build), I'd appreciate it a lot, because I'm bad at coming up with ideas for layouts.
